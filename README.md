Inbreeding-Coefficient-Calculation
==================================

An efficient inbreeding coefficient calculation algorithm implemented with C#

With increasingly growing knowledge of genetics and rapid accumulation of genealogy information, 
pedigree data is becoming very important. Efficiently identifying all pedigree paths for an individual 
plays an important role in computing genealogical measurements such as inbreeding 
and kinship coefficients of individuals. In this paper, we propose a new compact path encoding scheme, 
and present an efficient scheme for identifying paths on large pedigrees to enable path-based computations 
on pedigree graphs. We also use inbreeding coefficient computation as an example to demonstrate the space 
and time efficiency of our method. Compact Path Encoding scheme for path manipulations is applicable 
to general directed acyclic graphs in general. We perform experiments for comparing the efficiency 
of our method with the previous methods for evaluating inbreeding coefficients on pedigree graphs 
with real and synthetic data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting scheme is more 
scalable and efficient than previous methods both in terms of time and space requirements.
